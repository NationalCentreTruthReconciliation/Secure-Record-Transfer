                Below are your current active and expired sessions. Sessions will automatically
                expire after a period of inactivity. Expired sessions that are not part of a saved
                submission are automatically cleaned up on a schedule. To create space, you may
                delete or complete submissions that you have saved. See the <b>Actions</b> column
                below to resume or delete a saved submission.
