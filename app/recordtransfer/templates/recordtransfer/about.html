        The NCTR Record Transfer Portal allows people to send records to the National Centre for Truth
        and Reconciliation (NCTR) Archives securely over the internet. For small record submissions, this
        is the preferred method of sending records to the NCTR Archives.

            Submissions made through the transfer portal are subject to the maximum submission size.

            {{ MAX_TOTAL_UPLOAD_SIZE_MB }} MB of files</b>. Any <b>one file may not exceed

            amount, please split your submission into multiple parts, and use the group form to group similar
            submissions together so our archivists know your submissions are related.
