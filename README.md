# BagIt Transfer Portal

Please, [read the docs!](https://nctr-bagit-record-transfer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

This is a file transfer application made for securely transferring files over the internet and securing them in a BagIt bag for archivists to view. The CAAIS is observed in this application, and a large portion of the metadata fields specified in that document are present in this application's transfer form.

There is a lot more information in the [actual documentation](https://nctr-bagit-record-transfer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), so please look there for more information.
