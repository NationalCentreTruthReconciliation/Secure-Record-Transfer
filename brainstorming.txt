If we use a temporary file upload handler in Django, we can use the temp files it
generated and get their paths. From the paths, we can copy the temp files into a
folder of our creating, and bag that folder.

Once we have a bag all made and validated, we can do the following:
- Zip up the bag
- Upload the bag to somewhere else (this is a low-priority task and can be done in
the background)
- After the bag is uploaded, send an email to an archivist saying the bag is ready
to be inspected
