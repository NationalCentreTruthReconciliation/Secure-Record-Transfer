User Profile
============

The user profile page is where users can view and edit their personal information. Users can also
view their past submissions, in-progresss submissions and the submission groups they have created. The
user profile page is accessible by clicking on "Profile" on the navigation bar.

The Profile page has two tabs: "Account" and "Contact Information".

    :alt: User profile tabs

Account Tab
-----------
In the Account tab, users can view and edit their personal information. This includes
their name, email address and email notification preference, however, the email address field is read-only and cannot be changed from the Profile page. Users can also change their password here.

The "Receive notification emails?" checkbox allows users to control whether they want to receive
email notifications for new submissions. By default, this checkbox is checked.

To save changes made to personal information, click on the "Save" button.

Contact Information Tab
-----------------------
The Contact Information tab allows users to store their contact details including phone number and address. This information is stored in your profile for convenience.

.. image:: images/profile_contact_populate.webp
    :alt: User profile contact information

To save changes made to contact information, click on the "Save" button.

By completing this information once in your profile, these details will be automatically populated whenever you create a new submission in :ref:`Step 2: Contact information` of the Submission Form.  This saves time for users who make multiple submissions, as they won't need to re-enter their contact information for each submission.

Language Tab
------------
The Language tab allows users to change the language of the application. This is useful for users who are not comfortable with English, or who prefer to use a different language.

In-Progress Submissions
-----------------------
This section displays a table of all submissions that the user has started but not yet submitted.

.. image:: images/user_profile_in_progress_submissions.webp
    :alt: User profile in-progress submissions

The "Submission Title" column displays the title provided by the user in the "Title" field of
:ref:`Step 4: Record Description` of the Submission Form. If that field has not been filled out
yet, the title will be "None".

Expirable in-progress submissions will have an expiry date shown under the "Expires At" column.
This is the date when the in-progress submission will expire if it is not submitted or updated.
Expired in-progress submissions can no longer be resumed or submitted. In-progress submissions
close to expiring will have their expiry date highlighted in red, whereas in-progress submissions
that have already expired will have their expiry date both highlighted in red and striked through.

.. note::
    Only in-progress submissions with uploaded files can expire.

The length of time before an in-progress submission expires can be configured in the settings. See
:ref:`UPLOAD_SESSION_EXPIRE_AFTER_INACTIVE_MINUTES` and
:ref:`UPLOAD_SESSION_EXPIRED_CLEANUP_SCHEDULE` for more information.

A reminder email will be sent to the user before the in-progress submission expires. The amount of
time before the expiry date that the reminder email is sent can be configured in the settings. See
:ref:`UPLOAD_SESSION_EXPIRING_REMINDER_MINUTES` and
:ref:`IN_PROGRESS_SUBMISSION_EXPIRING_EMAIL_SCHEDULE` for more information.
