Why Does this App Exist?
========================

This application exists primarily to simplify and standardize the transfer and accessioning of
digital records. As archives begin to hold more digital material, it is becoming important to
digitize the workflows involved in maintaining the archives. A large amount of records created
nowadays are "born-digital," material that was created first in digital form. This app facilitates
the process of sending digital records to an archive, as well as packaging the material and its
associated metadata in a standardized way for archivists to view.

This application makes use of two specifications:

* BagIt (https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8493)
* Canadian Archival Accession Information Standard (http://archivescanada.ca/CWG_AccessionStandard)
