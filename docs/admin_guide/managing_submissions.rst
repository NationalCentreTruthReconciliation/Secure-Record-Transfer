Managing Submissions

administrator application. To access the submissions, click on **Submissions** in the admin home
page.

A list of all submissions will appear, with the most recent submissions at the top. To look for a 
specific submission, use the search bar at the top of the page. You can search by the donor's 
username or email, the submission's accession title, or the submission's UUID.

choose the format/version you want to export to, and click on the **Go** button.
