Adding Terms
============

To be inclusive of different types of transfers, the record transfer application allows for the
creation of various taxonomies. These include Rights Types, Source Roles, and Source Types that
users can select from when entering information for their submission. Some default terms are
included in the application, but you can remove them or add new terms to better fit the needs of
your organization.

To add new taxonomy terms, log in to a staff or super user account and go to the administrator
application (accessible at /admin/).

Adding Rights Types

To add new Rights Types, click on **Rights Types** in the admin interface.
