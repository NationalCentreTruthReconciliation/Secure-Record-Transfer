Private Archivist Application
=============================

Along with the main public facing application is a private application intended to be used by
archivists to view and manage the transfers made by users. This private application uses the
Django admin app with a bunch of useful custom archival administration functions built in.

The following sections provide a brief guide on the functions available to archivists. A complete
tutorial on the administration app is beyond the scope of this documentation.
