Running the App
===============

The following two sections indicate how you can get the app up and running in either a
Development/Debug environment, or in a Production environment. Running the production app can get
very involved, so be prepared to read.

In both cases, ensure you have followed the :ref:`Pre-Requisites to running` section to make sure
everything is installed and that you have a virtual Python environment ready to go.
